# Changelog

Entries for 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 were rewritten on 2026-08-25 after each claim was
checked against the code. Three features listed there as new had in fact
shipped in 1.2.0, and one explanation was wrong. They are corrected below and
credited to the release they actually came from.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-08-20

### Removed
- The `policy` template and its section — dead code. Shopify accepts the file
  on upload, but it never renders it: store policies at `/policies/…` are drawn
  by Shopify itself, inside your theme's header and footer. Verified by putting
  the template back with a marker in it — the marker never reached the page,
  which used Shopify's own `shopify-policy__container`. Nothing changes for
  stores. For a legal page you want in your menu, a regular Page gives the same
  centred reading column.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-20

### Added
- Complementary product recommendations. The **Related products** section now
  has a **Recommendation type** setting: *Related* picks products
  automatically, *Complementary* shows the ones you pair by hand in the free
  Shopify Search & Discovery app.
- The Related products section can now be added from the editor, and only on
  the product template. It shipped without a preset, so the second instance —
  the one you need to show complementary products alongside related ones —
  could not be added at all.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-20

### Added
- Shop Pay Installments banner on the product page and the featured product
  section, shown automatically when your store is eligible.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-11

First public release.

### Added
- Colour schemes: five editable schemes, selectable per section.
- 130 theme settings across 21 groups — typography, layout, animations,
  buttons, inputs, variant pills, product/collection/blog cards, content
  containers, media, popups, drawers, badges, brand information, search,
  currency format, cart.
- 22 addable sections, including slideshow, video, collage, multirow,
  collapsible content, collection list, featured blog, featured product,
  email signup banner, page content, quick order list, and app blocks.
- Express payment buttons (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shop Pay) on the product and
  featured product sections, with a **Show dynamic checkout buttons** switch on
  the Buy buttons block.
- Unit price on the product page and on product cards — required in the EU
  (Directive 98/6/EC) for anything sold by weight, volume or length. It appears
  once you set a unit of measure on the variant, and follows the selected one.
- Payment method logos in the footer, taken from the methods your store
  accepts. Setting: **Show payment icons**.
- Scroll reveal, configurable hover effect, LCP-aware image loading on the
  first row of product grids.

### Fixed
- Variant selection now posts correctly with JavaScript disabled: a `noscript`
  select carries the variant id, so the chosen variant is what reaches the cart.
- Product pages show the price of the selected variant, not the product minimum.
- Slideshow set to "adapt to first image" no longer exceeds the viewport width
  on phones.
- Secondary text and control borders stay above WCAG AA contrast on every
  shipped colour scheme.
- Shadow colour follows the active colour scheme instead of the first one.
- Price filter no longer multiplies values by 100 in comma-decimal currencies.
- Cart drawer refreshes after a bulk add, and the "Added to cart" confirmation
  stays visible.
- Product card buttons align across a row regardless of title length.

### Notes
- No external dependencies, no tracking, no CDN calls.
- Every purchase path works without JavaScript.
